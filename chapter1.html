  <h1>CHAPTER 1 : Awakening</h1>

  <div>A young boy shook violently on the metal operating table. His wrists and ankles were strapped down by thick leather belts. He kicked, trying to break free, his screams echoing through the cold, empty room.

Blue lights blinked above him. A machine beeped nearby, showing his heartbeat and brainwaves on a glowing screen.

From the corner, a man stepped forward. His face was hidden behind a cloth mask, burned scars peeking beneath. In his hand, a thick syringe filled with glowing green liquid.

He looked at the boy’s face and whispered, “I became that thing,” his voice low with frustration.

He grabbed the boy’s arm. The boy’s eyes widened. He thrashed harder, but the man didn’t stop.

The syringe pierced his skin. The green liquid pushed in. The boy tensed—then dropped still. His eyes stayed open, but blank.

Under the table, machines hummed as the chip was inserted.

BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!

Arin snapped awake, sweat clinging to his skin. His chest rose and fell rapidly as he gasped for breath.

He ran a shaky hand down his face, wiping the dampness away.
“Damn… what kind of dream was that?” he muttered.

Still dazed, he sat up, swung his legs over the edge of the bed, and stood.

With slow steps, he walked to the window and pulled the curtain aside.

Sunlight poured in—warm and blinding. It hit his face like a quiet slap.

He closed his eyes and took a deep breath.

“…Fresh start,” he whispered, staring at the wide open sky.
He turned around, walked to his desk, and grabbed his headphones. As soft, refreshing music began to play, he headed to the bathroom, brushing his teeth while gazing out the window at the morning sky.

He stopped the music and set his phone down. As he undressed slowly, his mind wandered—quiet, heavy with questions he wasn’t allowed to ask or even think.

He stepped into the shower. A drop of cold water hit his face, but he didn’t flinch.

He stepped out of the shower, calmly drying his hair with a hair dryer. With wet hands, he grabbed a towel, dried himself off, and wrapped it around his waist.

He opened his wardrobe, pulled out his neatly ironed school uniform, and stood before the mirror with a straight posture.

Dressed sharp, hair still slightly damp, he looked at his reflection and spoke quietly, barely parting his lips:
“Let’s make this a perfect day, Captain.”

He descended the stairs with a soft, composed gait.

At the foot of the stairs, he spotted his mother standing before the hallway mirror. She was tying her hair into a bun, her work bag clutched in one hand.

“Good morning, Mom,” Arin said gently, offering a faint, polite smile.

She turned to him with a pale, expressionless face.
“Oh. Good morning, Arin. Don’t cause any trouble at school. Mr. Nuvor dislikes disorder.”

Arin mumbled under his breath, lips twitching in annoyance,
“Yeah, yeah. I devour kids for breakfast.”

“Did you say something?” she asked flatly, without turning from the mirror.

“Nothing. I’ll see you this evening. I’m heading off now,” he replied quickly, already reaching for the door.

“Yes. Bye. See you at school,” she said—her voice lifeless, almost robotic.

As Arin stepped out of his house, he paused at the doorstep, eyes lifting to the sky.
“Something’s going to happen…” he whispered, the words slipping out before he could stop them.

He shook his head, brushing off the thought, and grabbed his bicycle.

The moment his wheels hit the road, a sharp gust of wind swept across his face—cold, crisp, and biting.

As Arin pedaled, he took a quick look around—a town so perfect, every building looked the same, with the same color and shape. He raised an eyebrow in doubt, then glanced back at the road. Taking a deep breath, he murmured in exhaustion,
"Ah… never mind. I’m at school now."

He calmly parked his bicycle inside the school premises and climbed the stairs to his class. As he opened the door, he noticed someone was already there.

Arin smiled, placed his hand on his knees, and said with a soft chuckle,
“I can never be as punctual as you, no matter how hard I try, Vivan.”

Vivan, seated on the bench, shifted his posture—resting his elbow on the desk and leaning slightly forward.
“I’ve told you many times—”

Before he could finish, Arin cut in smoothly while settling into his seat, his movements perfectly in sync with Vivan’s words.
“To defeat you, I have to become Vivan himself.”

He placed his bag down with a faint smile.
“The whole school knows this line of yours by heart.”

As Arin talked to Vivan, he rolled his eyes across the whole classroom and bit his lip.
“Tsk… You’ve done everything again, as always. What am I even supposed to do now?”

Vivan, slouched lazily on the bench, responded without lifting his head.
“Yeah, obviously. You can thank me later if you want.”

Arin frowned, a mix of irritation and nervousness on his face.
“Thank my foot. You always do this. I’m the captain, damn it. You know how Justin even thinks of me now?”

Just then, a familiar voice came from the doorway.
“Yeah, why would I consider someone captain who lives in someone else’s shadow?”

Arin turned toward the door — and there stood Justin.
He sighed in his head. Oh god… not now

Justin leaned against the doorway, smirking.
“What happened, ‘Captain’? Thinking, oh god, not now?” he said with a mocking laugh.

Arin shot him an irritated look.
“At least I don’t cry in front of the mirror after a junior throws a one-liner,” he fired back. “What happened, coward? Still can’t get over that amazing day?” He chuckled darkly.

Justin’s smirk vanished. His fists clenched as anger flared in his eyes.
“You need a punch massage, you arrogant—”
He charged forward.

Arin didn’t move. Still seated, he cracked his neck and stretched his arms.
“I guess I have to end this today,” he muttered under his breath.

They were inches from colliding when—

A wave of stillness cut through the tension. Something in the air shifted. A silent authority pulsed across their skin.
Then, a voice—calm but absolute—echoed across the room:

“Stop.”

Vivan’s voice.

Both boys froze. Not because they wanted to. Because they had to.
As Justin’s eyes met Vivan’s, he quickly looked away and slumped into his seat, muttering under his breath,
“What was that gaze…? It felt like a demon craving blood.”

One by one, students began entering the classroom. A strange awkwardness hung in the air — like something unseen was pressing down on them. The bold, silent presence of the three big shots—Arin, Vivan, and Justin—shifted the mood entirely. The moment should’ve felt ordinary… but it wasn’t.
As the room filled with the usual noise and energetic chatter, the whole atmosphere slowly twisted into a wave of chaotic student voices.

As the teacher stepped into the room, the entire class fell into pin-drop silence. Students began stretching lazily, pulling out their notebooks and textbooks from their bags.

Suddenly, Vivan stretched his arms with a casual yawn and called out,
“Alright, everyone — time to gear up for six hours of fun!”
His energetic voice cut through the stiffness in the air, lifting the mood just enough to keep things moving.

After six hours, students sat with stiff shoulders, heads drooping as they stared at the ticking clock. The echo of the teacher’s chalk scratching the board filled the silent room—until the bell rang. A sudden rush of energy surged through the classroom.
The teacher set her belongings on the desk — Tak! — and raised her voice above the chaos and chatter, joyful yet firm.

“There will be a mountain picnic in two weeks—with your juniors. Lord Nuvor himself will be joining us.”

At the mention of Lord Nuvor, a ripple of excitement—and unease—passed through the classroom.

A group of girls immediately burst into hushed whispers, wide-eyed.

“Woah, we’ll get to see Lord Nuvor with our own eyes!”
“I heard he carries a completely different atmosphere with him.”

Near the window, Arin was quietly packing his books into his bag.

“Lord Nuvor and mountain stuff is quite cool,” he muttered to Vivan, “but why with juniors? That’s never happened before.”

Justin leaned over Arin’s desk with a grin.
“What are you talking about, Captain? I heard you’re babysitting two of them.”

Before Arin could respond, Justin laughed and walked off toward the door.

Arin made an irritated face and murmured to Vivan,
"What's wrong with him? He always acts like he’s that cool side character in an anime."

Vivan grinned.
"Yeah, totally bro. Don’t ruin your mood because of him. Let’s just go for the ritual."

Arin’s expression shifted.
"Yeah, definitely. It’s the most important thing out  ther----"

Before he could finish, the ritual bell rang.

Everyone immediately stood up and began walking toward the Hall of Liquid-like robots—silent, stiff, and in a perfect line.
As Arin and Vivan entered the hall, they were hit with a bitter, metallic scent and the faint echo of students shouting ahead.

Arin rolled his eyes across the hall, painted in a sickly green shade, where a teacher stood near the exit, watching silently.

A few minutes later, it was Arin’s turn.
He bowed slightly to the teacher.

A red liquid poured onto his head.

A sharp electric jolt shot through his skull.

"OUCH!"
A scream burst out from his mouth as his body flinched involuntarily.

As Arin walks through the exit, a wave of dizziness hits him. The world around him shifts strangely, as if reality itself is slightly off. He presses a hand to his forehead, steadying himself, and catches sight of Vivan beside him—just as dazed.

With a faint smile, barely parting his lips, Arin mutters,
“We’ve been going through this since the day we were born… yet it still feels heavy. Every single time.”
Vivan silently nods in agreement as the two make their way toward their bicycles, their steps slightly uneven.

As the dizziness fades from each student, an emergency siren blares across the entire school.

Arin and Vivan’s expressions shift instantly—forgetting their pain, panic sets in.

“What the hell was that?!” Arin shouts.
“It’s the ritual break siren!” Vivan yells back.

The two start sprinting toward the school building, trying to figure out what’s going on. Suddenly, a familiar voice calls out from behind:

“Help, senpai!”

They turn to see their junior, Vinith, standing near the school’s exit gate, gasping for breath. The boys rush toward him.

“Vinith, what happened?!” Vivan demands.

Vinith, struggling to speak, stammers,
“S-senpai… it’s the Sheeran alarm. He—he ran from the ritual…”

“WHAT?!” Arin and Vivan shout in unison.

Arin crouches, locking eyes with him.
“You didn’t try to stop him?”

Tears well up in Vinith’s eyes.
“I tried! I ran after him, but he wouldn’t listen… He always acts weird, but this time he ran—right in front of the teacher…”

Arin and Vivan exchange a numb, heavy glance.

Arin mutters, more to himself than anyone else,
“I knew something was off this morning… but this?”

He takes a deep breath, grounding himself, then gently wipes Vinith’s tears. Wrapping him in a quick hug, he pats his head and says softly,
“Don’t cry. Vivan and I will handle it. Just go home—and don’t tell anyone what happened. I’ll drop you off myself.”

He steadies Vinith by the shoulder, then walks over to his bicycle.

With a calm, reassuring smile, he says,
“Hop on. We’ll figure something out by tomorrow.”

Arin let out a deep breath, calming the storm inside him. He looked at Vivan—silent, steady—and gave a small nod.

“Understandable. Bye,” he said, softly. Just those words, but Vivan got the message. He always did.

Arin turned toward Vinith and ruffled his hair gently.

“Let’s get you home.”

As Arin pedaled his cycle through the quiet streets, Vinith sitting behind him, he glanced back and said,
"Cheer up, kid. Believe in me and Vivan—we can survive anything. So cut the sad crap already and tell me... is there any girl you like?"

Vinith’s face lit up a little, the weight on his shoulders easing as Arin’s words wrapped around him like comfort.
"Huh? What are you even talking about, senpai?" he muttered, cheeks turning red. "There’s no girl I like... but I do think Sheeran likes someone."

Arin’s brows rose with curiosity.
"Oh-ho? Who?! Tell me quick!"

Vinith grinned. "One day I went over to Sheeran's place, and I saw him talking to this 12th grade girl. His eyes were sparkling, senpai—like, I’ve never seen him like that before."

Arin jolted, the cycle wobbling.
"WHAAAT? That little Sheeran?! Acting all tough and mature... meanwhile he’s out here falling for seniors?"

"Woah, calm down, senpai!" Vinith laughed as Arin got the cycle back under control.

They both burst into laughter, a much-needed escape from the tension of the day.

Soon after, Arin slowed down in front of Vinith’s house.
"Alright, we’re here. Go in, and don’t think about all this crap too much. Everything will be fine."

Vinith hopped off, his smile wide and warm.
"Aye aye, captain. You’re really like a big brother to me, you know that?"

Arin gave him a small, genuine smile, watching as Vinith stepped into his home. But the moment the door shut behind the boy, Arin’s expression hardened.

His eyes narrowed. His grip on the handle tightened.

"It’s serious now... if me and Vivan can’t figure something out, the Foundation will show Sheeran real hell."

He blinked twice and looked up at the sky. A cold gust of wind brushed over him like a warning.

Then he looked ahead—and froze.

Black Foundation vehicles were parked outside his house.

He rushed forward, ditching the cycle on the pavement. By the time he got there, the cars were gone. But the front door was ajar.

Something foul was in the air.

He stepped inside.

The stench of blood hit him like a brick wall.

The vase Mr. Nuvor had gifted them—shattered on the floor. Blood splattered across the walls and floor like a grotesque mural.

Arin staggered forward with trembling steps, each one heavier than the last.

And then he saw it.

His mother—what remained of her. Body parts scattered across the floor. Her limbs strung up on the fan, slowly rotating like a grotesque wind chime. Blood soaked the walls like abstract art, still wet, still warm.

Arin didn’t blink.

He just stood there.

Then… a twitch.

His lips curved—slightly at first.

Then wider.

Wider.

His chest heaved.

And a sound crawled out of his throat.

A laugh.

Dry.

Crooked.

Cracking like glass under pressure.

It began as a wheeze. Then a gasp. Then—

HAA— HAHA— HAAHAHA— HAHAHHAA—!

His laughter burst through the silence like a siren.

Shrill. Animalistic. Broken.

It clawed through the room, echoing off bloodstained walls.
Not joy. Not relief. Not madness.
Just a hollow noise from a body too shattered to scream.
