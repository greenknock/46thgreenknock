      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>
        Set in a not-so-distant future where memories can be altered and emotions digitized, <strong>The 46th Green Knock</strong> follows Sheeran, a man whose past is riddled with blackouts, loss, and haunting glimpses of a forgotten crime. When a mysterious murder resurfaces and emotional memory chips are found tampered, Sheeran is forced to dive deep into a psychological labyrinth where nothing is certain — not even himself.
