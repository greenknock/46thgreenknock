    <h2>📖 About the Book</h2>
    <p>
      In a town shaped by memory and controlled by silence, a group of students begins to unravel threads they were never meant to touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As old fears stir beneath peaceful mountains and friendships begin to tangle with something darker, a quiet boy, a stoic senior, and an unlikely crew find themselves pulled into a place where memories fade, truths twist, and every moment feels like a warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Told through subtle shifts of tone—from warmth to dread—this is a slow-burning psychological drama with flashes of dark humor, school life, and a creeping mystery. Beneath the lighthearted banter and teenage chaos, a question pulses quietly: <strong>What’s really happening in this town—and why does no one remember?</strong>

      This story means more than just a narrative—it’s a reflection of emotion, trauma, and the things we bury deep within our minds. Through Sheeran, Arin, Wamiqa, and the mysteries that twist through their memories, I hope to offer you something haunting, yet strangely familiar.
