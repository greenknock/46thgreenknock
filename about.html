      <h2>About the Book</h2>
      <p>
        The story takes place in a future not too far from now — a world where memories can be changed and emotions are no longer felt, just controlled like data. People smile, but it's programmed. They remember things, but those memories might not even be real., <strong>The 46th Green Knock</strong> THE 46th GREEN KNOCK is about six high school students living in a town that looks perfect — maybe too perfect. Everything feels a little too quiet, too controlled. People smile, but something’s missing.
