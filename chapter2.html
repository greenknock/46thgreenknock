  <div class="chapter-content">
  <p>Haha… hahah… hah… ha.</p>
<p>Arin’s throat tightened with soreness, the laugh fading into silence as the scent of his mother's lifeless body and blood choked his nose. His vision blurred, a fog clinging to his eyelashes.</p>
<p>His legs wobbled — and he collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>His eyes rolled slowly around the room, remembering the robotic nature and hollowness of the woman who raised him.</p>
<p>Head tilting, eyes locked on his palm, words slipped through barely parted lips:</p>
<p><strong>“Wh...y, why can’t... I feel... anything? Neither sadness nor joy...”</strong></p>
<p>His body gave out completely, slumping onto the blood-covered floor, eyes barely managing to stay open.</p>
<p>Trin... trin... trin...</p>
<p>Limbs responded sluggishly as the phone rang. His hand dragged deliberately into his pocket to pull it out.</p>
<p>He stared at the screen for minutes, vision struggling to focus on the caller’s name. A husky murmur escaped:</p>
<p><strong>“It’s Viv...an...”</strong></p>
<p>Cold fingers swiped across the screen to answer.</p>
<p>A voice barely above a whisper slipped out: <strong>“Viv...an...”</strong></p>
<p>But the call ended almost instantly. On the other end, a quiet mutter:</p>
<p><strong>“I think something happened to him. That wasn’t his voice.”</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly, an unfamiliar shout from behind broke the air.</p>
<p><strong>“Vivan, wait!”</strong></p>
<p>Eyebrows lifted in surprise at the distinctly feminine tone. A glance over the shoulder confirmed it — a beautiful girl, rushing forward, face tired, eyes brimming with unease, still shouting the name.</p>
<p>He jolted. Fingers smoothed through his hair, dampened by saliva. A whisper echoed in his mind:</p>
<p><strong>“I’ve done some great work... Got so famous, huh.”</strong></p>
<p>He stood completely still, the cold air brushing against his face.</p>
<p>She stepped closer, slow and deliberate, her hair waving slightly with each motion. Fingers snapped right in front of his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>“What’s wrong with him?” she murmured.</strong></p>
<p>No reaction — so she pinched him.</p>
<p>A blink.</p>
<p><strong>“Whoa. What was that for?”</strong></p>
<p>Her brow tightened, a mix of worry and irritation flashing across her face.</p>
<p><strong>“Where were you? You weren’t paying attention at all.”</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Hmm… do I know you?”</strong></p>
<p>She hesitated, cheeks coloring slightly.</p>
<p><strong>“Uh… hi. I’m Wamiqa, Sheeran’s neighbor.”</strong></p>
<p>His expression softened, hand rubbing the back of his neck.</p>
<p><strong>“Oh, nice to meet you. I’m Vivan.”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa’s tone shifted, eyes filled with concern.</p>
<p><strong>“You’re going to find Sheeran?”</strong></p>
<p>The playful air faded.</p>
<p><strong>“Yeah. Do you know where we can find him?”</strong></p>
<p>She nodded quickly, voice a bit panicked.</p>
<p><strong>“Not exactly, but we have to find him before the Foundation reaches him.”</strong></p>
<p>A slight head tilt.</p>
<p><strong>“That’s your bike, right? Take me with you.”</strong></p>
<p>He glanced back.</p>
<p><strong>“Yeah, it’s mine. Of course, let’s find him together.”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa replied, <strong>“Definitely,”</strong> and hopped on the bike.</p>
<p><strong>“Are you comfortable?”</strong></p>
<p>She nodded silently.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the engine roared louder. She gripped him tighter, pulled by the force of acceleration.</p>
<p>As they weaved through the city streets, Wamiqa asked, <strong>“Where are we going? I don’t think we’ll find Sheeran here. This is the main city area.”</strong></p>
<p>Vivan smiled slightly. <strong>“Yeah, you’re right. But we’re going to find two people who’ll be a big help to us.”</strong></p>
<p>She raised an eyebrow, concern creeping onto her face. <strong>“If you say so. But do you actually have a plan?”</strong></p>
<p>Vivan smirked and replied, <strong>“Plan? Definitely — I do have a plan. We’ll follow the Foundation’s movements while Arin and Vinith look for Sheeran.”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa responded in a surprised tone, <strong>“Arin and Vinith? I’ve met Vinith… and I’ve heard a lot about the Arin–Vivan duo.”</strong></p>
<p>A small, confident smile curved Vivan’s lips. <strong>“Woah, then don’t be tense if you’ve heard about us. We always have a plan — and luck on our side.”</strong></p>
<p>She mirrored his smile. <strong>“Uh! I have to admit… you really can change any mood.”</strong></p>
<p>Vivan’s cheeks flushed red. Just as he was about to respond, his eyes lifted to the sky. He murmured, <strong>“Something definitely happened.”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa shot him a doubtful glance. <strong>“What happened? Is something wrong?”</strong></p>
<p>Vivan’s grip on the bike tightened slightly, his voice turning tense. <strong>“No… nothing happened.”</strong></p>
<p>Then silence. The memory of Arin’s voice over the phone seeped in.</p>
 <p>Far from the noise of the city, Arin was fighting a storm of his own.</p>
<p>Blood smeared across his shirt, arms, and even his face as he moved slowly. Each step toward his room felt heavier than the last. He leaned against the wall for support, breath shallow and uneven.</p>
<p><strong>“But why… why did they kill her?”</strong> The whisper barely escaped his lips.</p>
<p>Through the window, the town lay still — eerily peaceful. Too peaceful.</p>
<p>Teeth clenched, he muttered:</p>
<p><strong>“Why does this town look so perfect… when everything’s falling apart?”</strong></p>
<p>Bloodied clothes peeled off and fell to the floor. He stepped into the shower.</p>
<p>Cold water poured over his skin, washing away more than blood. It tried to strip him of rage, confusion, grief.</p>
<p>But the pain clung stubbornly.</p>
<p>Fists slammed against the tiles. Tears streaked down, raw and wild.</p>
<p><strong>“Why… why is this happening to me?!”</strong></p>
<p>He slid down to the floor, curling inward, back pressed against the wall. Both hands covered his face.</p>
<p>Sobs filled the shower stall — desperate echoes of everything he couldn’t put into words.</p>
<p>Arin clutched his ears as flashes of ritualistic screams and hollow shouts from the night before Townexo surged back into his mind.</p>
<p><strong>KAAAHNK! KAAAHNK!</strong></p>
<p>His eyes snapped open. On instinct, he stood up — recognizing Vivan’s bike horn. Quickly, he wiped the tears from his face.</p>
<p>He paused at the door, slapped his cheeks lightly, and whispered to himself: <strong>“This isn’t about me right now.”</strong></p>
<p>Pulling on a shacket and cargo pants, he wore a fake smile as armor. Then, he stepped outside.</p>
<p><strong>“Where are we going?”</strong></p>
<p>Vivan noticed Arin’s pale face and asked, <strong>“Are you okay, Arin?”</strong></p>
<p>Arin forced a grin. <strong>“What would happen to—”</strong> He froze mid-sentence as his eyes landed on the girl sitting behind Vivan’s bike. His expression shifted to surprise. <strong>“Wait a minute… who is she?”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa, clearly in a hurry and slightly annoyed, replied bluntly: <strong>“Me? Hi, I’m Wamiqa, Sheeran’s neighbor. You must be Arin.”</strong></p>
<p>Arin’s eyes widened. <strong>“Woah… you’re that neighbor?”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa frowned slightly, irritation in her tone: <strong>“You two don’t realize the urgency of the situation — and you start small talk? Let’s save it for later. Let’s find Sheeran.”</strong></p>
<p>Arin blinked, embarrassed. <strong>“Wait… he wasn’t at his house?”</strong></p>
<p>Wamiqa turned to Vivan with a sharp look. <strong>“You told me he’s a genius. Isn’t it obvious, Arin?”</strong></p>
<p>Arin hurried to grab his bike. <strong>“You guys go ahead, I’ll catch up.”</strong></p>
<p>Vivan grinned. <strong>“10-4, Captain. We’ll follow the Foundation car.”</strong> With that, he revved the engine and disappeared into the distance.</p>
<p>Arin hopped on his bike and exhaled deeply. His gaze drifted toward the sky. <strong>“So calm… yet so devastating,”</strong> he murmured. <strong>“Focus on the main thing, Arin.”</strong></p>”</strong> With that, he revved the engine and disappeared into the distance.</p>
 
 <p>He reached into his pocket, pulled out his phone, and quickly dialed Vinith. The call barely rang before it connected — a voice snapped through:</p>
  <p><strong>“Come outside. Quickly.”</strong></p>
   <p>Arin rolled up outside Vinith’s place, barely stopping before Vinith jumped on — quick and wordless, like he already knew. No time for small talk. They took off right away, the wind eating their silence.</p>
   <p>The city felt quieter than usual. Arin’s eyes scanned every turn — until something by the alley wall caught his attention. Two figures, crouched. Wait… Vivan and Wamiqa?</p>
  <p>He hit the brakes gently and pulled over. <strong>“Wait here,”</strong> he muttered to Vinith before stepping off.</p>
   <p>Keeping low, he crept up, a little smirk forming — like he was about to spook them just for the hell of it.</p>
   <p>Then, he pat on Vivan's shoulder silently.</p>
   <p>Vivan flinched hard, jolted by the sudden touch on his shoulder. On instinct, he spun around and almost threw a punch.</p>
   <p>His voice shot up, high-pitched and alarmed, <strong>“What the—”</strong></p>
   <p>Then immediately dropped to a whisper as he recognized the face. <strong>“…What the hell, man? You can clearly see we’re monitoring something.”</strong></p>
   <p>Arin raised both hands slightly in apology and leaned in, whispering, <strong>“Sorry. What’s the situation?”</strong></p>
   <p>Wamiqa didn’t respond with words. She simply pointed ahead, her finger aimed at a Foundation car parked near the alley’s edge.</p>
   <p>Arin followed the direction of her hand, cautiously tilting his head around the corner of the wall to stay out of sight. His eyes locked onto the bus as he focused, tuning into the muffled voices just ahead.</p>
   <p><strong>“…Let’s leave that boy for now. We’ve got an emergency in Town 08. Get in the car quickly—we need to report to headquarters.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan, Wamiqa, and Vinith jumped in joy as the sound of the Foundation car faded into the distance.</p>
    <p>With a wide, relieved smile, Vivan exclaimed, <strong>“Let’s go, guys! We’ve got plenty of time to find a solution.”</strong></p>
    <p>But then his eyes shifted to Arin, who stood still—his face pale, expression unreadable.</p>
    <p>Vivan frowned slightly. <strong>“What happened, Arin? Why are you standing like that? We just got good news.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin didn’t look up. His gaze stayed fixed on the ground, voice low but firm. <strong>“Yeah… but they mentioned Town 08. So there are other towns too.”</strong></p>
    <p>The words hit hard.</p>
    <p>A sudden silence fell over the group. No one said a word. They just stood there, frozen, trying to process what Arin had just said.</p>
    <p>After a minute of heavy silence, Arin finally spoke in a low tone, <strong>“I’ve been noticing it since yesterday… this town feels like some kind of electronic system. All the buildings are the same size, same design… even the way adults act.”</strong></p>
    <p>He paused, his voice dropping further. <strong>“And now this ‘Town 08’... Ever since we were born, we were taught this is the only world that exists.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin glanced at everyone’s expressions, then clapped his hands, trying to shift the mood. <strong>“Come on, guys. There’s nothing to be shocked or weird about. It’s actually good news—we’ve got more time, and there’s a whole world beyond this town. We’ll explore it together.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan gave a faint smile. <strong>“Yeah. Let’s hop on our bikes, guys. We need to find Sheeran and share this with him.”</strong></p>
    <p>He turned to Vinith, placing a hand on his shoulder. <strong>“Come on, man, cheer up. Give us a clue—where do you think Sheeran might have gone?”</strong></p>
    <p>Vinith replied in a low voice, <strong>“I think we might find him in the jungle near the park.”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa, visibly tense, responded, <strong>“What? There’s a jungle? He went there to hide? What a carefree kid…”</strong></p>
    <p>Vinith smirked and said, <strong>“Yeah, he’s definitely still a kid. Let’s hop on the bikes, guys.”</strong></p>
    <p>As they moved towards the jungle Vinith pointed ahead, giving quick directions. <strong>“Take a left here... now a right.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin glanced sideways at the dense thicket coming into view. <strong>“So this is the jungle you were talking about.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin and Vivan parked their bikes, and the group stepped into the jungle together. As they navigated through the thick foliage, Arin suddenly spoke up:</p>
    <p><strong>“If we keep searching like this, we’ll never find him. Let’s split into two groups and move in opposite directions. If you and Wamiqa spot anything, just give a whistle — we’ll head straight to you. And don’t go too far.”</strong></p>
    <p>After hours of searching, a sharp whistle echoed through the jungle. Arin's face lit up with a small smile. <strong>“Vinith, let’s go. Vivan must’ve found something.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vinith, eyes wide with excitement, grinned. <strong>“Yes, senpai! Let’s move!”</strong></p>
    <p>The two dashed through the dense forest, following the sound of the whistle. As they reached the source, Arin came to a sudden halt, eyes widening.</p>
    <p><strong>“What is this...? An old temple? Or ruins?”</strong></p>
    <p>Vinith, his voice filled with shock, said, <strong>“What is this? Me and Sheeran have never seen this place before.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin narrowed his eyes, glancing at Vinith. <strong>“Really? But more importantly, where are Vivan and Wami—”</strong></p>
    <p>He suddenly shifted his stance, lowering his voice to a whisper. <strong>“Wait… take cover. Someone’s running toward us.”</strong></p>
    <p>They crouched behind a stone ledge, focusing their eyes on the movement ahead—only to see Vivan and Wamiqa sprinting toward them.</p>
    <p>Arin stepped out of cover, confused. <strong>“What the—? Why are you two running?”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan bent over, hands on his knees, breathing heavily. <strong>“We were way ahead… then we heard a whistle coming from your direction, so we rushed back.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vinith's eyes widened in fear. <strong>“W-What? What are you saying, senpai? If you guys didn’t whistle… then who did?”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa’s eyes widened in shock. <strong>“What’s happening? We heard your whistle… and you heard ours?”</strong></p>
    <p>A tear slipped down her cheek.</p>
    <p>Arin, keeping a calm voice and steady posture, said, <strong>“Calm down, guys.”</strong></p>
    <p>He turned his gaze toward the ruins. <strong>“Let’s search this place together. Maybe Sheeran’s inside.”</strong></p>
    <p>As they stepped into the ruins, a heavy silence settled over them—each of them feeling the weight of concern and fear.</p>
    <p>Vivan ran his hand along the mossy wall. <strong>“What a beautiful place... Look at these ancient designs.”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa’s eyes locked onto a carving. She pointed. <strong>“Wait, guys… look at this figure.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vinith leaned in, puzzled. <strong>“What does it even mean?”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa responded slowly, <strong>“I’ve studied some ancient sculptures. If you look closely… this seems like a short story.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan raised an eyebrow. <strong>“A short story? Can you describe it?”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa gently brushed the dust off the wall and began explaining: <strong>“See this? It’s a child walking down a street. As he grows, seven bars are removed from his head… and then he turns into a puppet.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin’s eyes widened. <strong>“Seven bars? What does that mean?”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa shook her head. <strong>“I don’t know. It’s written in a different language. I’ve never seen it before. Maybe it’s from outside the town.”</strong></p>
    <p>She read aloud from the inscriptions carved into each bar: <strong>“Amor, Lussuria, Avidité, Celos, Jison Shin, Apego, Kopam.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan smirked. <strong>“Woah… sounds like an alien language.”</strong></p>
    <p>Arin glanced at the group. <strong>“Let’s find Sheeran. why to wase time on something we can't understand.”</strong></p>
    <p>Everyone nodded silently and marched deeper into the ruins, their focus now on finding Sheeran.</p>
    <p>Suddenly, Vinith shouted, <strong>“Look! There’s a basement!”</strong> and ran toward it before anyone could react.</p>
    <p>Arin called out in concern, <strong>“Wait! Don’t go alone!”</strong> But before he could stop him, Vinith had already disappeared into the basement.</p>
    <p>With a deep breath, Arin said, <strong>“Let’s go after him, guys.”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa and Vivan gave him a nod of agreement and followed him down the stairs with quiet, cautious steps.</p>
    <p>As they descended, Wamiqa wrinkled her nose and said, <strong>“This basement has a strange smell…”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan replied, <strong>“Yeah, you’re right. This place feels... odd.”</strong></p>
    <p>As they moved deeper into the darkness, Arin squinted and murmured, <strong>“I think… it’s Sheeran and Vinith talking.”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa spotted Sheeran too. Joy welled up in her eyes and she rushed forward. As she reached him—</p>
    <p><strong>Whack!</strong></p>
    <p>She slapped Sheeran across the face.</p>
    <p><strong>“What was that f—”</strong> Sheeran began, but before he could finish, she threw her arms around him in a tight hug and said, <strong>“Don’t ever do something like this again.”</strong></p>
    <p>As she held him, Sheeran felt a warmth radiate through him, and a relieved smile gently escaped his lips.</p>
    <p>Vinith coughed, clearly trying to interrupt. <strong>“Ahem... ahem... Guys, let’s head back. This place is giving me the creeps already.”</strong></p>
    <p>Wamiqa broke the hug, her cheeks flushed red. <strong>“Y-Yeah, let’s go,”</strong> she said quickly.</p>
    <p>Sheeran looked hesitant. <strong>“How can I leave? The Foundation is still searching the area outside.”</strong></p>
    <p>Vivan reassured him, <strong>“Don’t worry—they’ve returned to headquarters for now due to… other reasons. I’ll explain everything later. For now, let’s head home.”</strong></p>
    <p>They began walking toward the exit, smiles of relief on their faces—until they came to a halt.</p>
    <p>A huge wall had appeared, blocking the entrance—a wall that hadn’t been there before.</p>
    <p>Everyone froze, panic setting in as they scrambled to make sense of it, searching for a clue.</p>
    <p>Then Wamiqa spotted something etched into the surface and read aloud:</p>
    <p><strong>“Velkominn, Von, Tölur fjörutíu og sex.”</strong></p>
