<p>Wamiqa’s brow creased as her eyes scanned the strange inscription. Her lips moved without sound, almost like she was tasting the words before speaking them aloud.</p>
<p>“Group number… forty-six,” she finally said. Her voice was calm, but there was something in her eyes — a shadow of unease.</p>
<p>The wall gave a deep, grinding groan, like two mountains scraping together. Dust trickled down from the ceiling in lazy streams. Slowly, the stone parted, revealing a narrow arched doorway. Above it, the number 46 was carved in a way that felt… watchful.</p>
<p>Vinith leaned forward on his toes, practically buzzing.</p>
<p>“Senpai, is this—” his voice cracked halfway, “—is this some kind of secret training room?!”</p>
<p>Arin’s mouth twitched, the corners threatening to lift despite the tension hanging in the air.</p>
<p>“Only one way to find out,” Arin said, stepping forward like the place had been waiting for him. He brushed a bit of dust off his shoulder, casual as ever, and walked through.</p>
<p>The others shared a quick glance, then followed.</p>
<p>The air inside was cooler. There was the faint scent of old stone and paper, with something metallic lurking underneath. Faint glimmers of gold caught the torchlight, running through the carvings on the walls. Between them, strange mechanical joints twitched and hummed in a way that made the place feel alive.</p>
<p>Sheeran’s gaze kept darting from wall to ceiling. He tried to keep his usual loose, tough-guy posture, but his shoulders were a fraction too stiff. It’s just a room, he told himself — though his pulse didn’t agree.</p>
<p>Vinith, meanwhile, had already spotted a weapon rack.</p>
<p>“Whoa…” His fingers hovered just short of the blades. The metal gleamed like it had been forged yesterday, yet the shapes were nothing like modern weapons. “Are these even from our time?”</p>
<p>Sheeran picked one up, turning it in his hands. The weight felt strange — too perfect.</p>
<p>“Guess even history liked to show off,” he said, but his gaze kept flicking toward Wamiqa.</p>
<p>She was standing at the far wall, her attention swallowed by a massive puzzle-map in gold and ink. Her fingertips hovered a breath away from the surface, as though touching it might shatter it.</p>
<p>“This… this is older than anything I’ve seen in the museum,” she murmured.</p>
<p>On the other side of the room, Arin crouched next to Vivan in front of a low stone pedestal.</p>
<p>“Think this is the exit key?” Arin asked, tapping it with that easy grin that always made him look like he knew more than he did.</p>
<p>Vivan didn’t answer right away. His eyes moved across the carvings, sharp and calculating.</p>
<p>“Keys don’t usually hum,” he said finally, fingers tracing the surface with slow precision.</p>
<p>“Only one way to be sure—” Arin pressed the symbol before Vivan could stop him.</p>
<p>A deep vibration rolled through the floor. The air above them shimmered like heat on stone, and with a soft click, something began to take shape — a flickering projection, glowing in the dim light.</p>
<p>The clicking of pens and rustle of papers froze as the projection whirred to life. All eyes turned upward.</p>
<h2>Reality.</h2>
<p>The image shifted. A vast castle loomed under a white-grey sky, its eight floors barely visible through the curtain of snowfall. The stone walls looked ancient, rotting from the inside out, yet something about it felt alive—watching. A cold wind howled through shattered windows, carrying with it the muffled cries of newborns.</p>
<p>The view crept closer until it breached a window frame.</p>
<p>Inside, a massive hall stretched endlessly, lined with rows upon rows of cribs. Dozens—no, hundreds—of babies writhed, tiny fists thrashing at the air, mouths open in shrill, discordant wails.</p>
<p>The siren began. The same, metallic howl Arin, Vivan, and Vinith had once heard—unmistakable, drilling straight into memory.</p>
<p>Arin’s eyes narrowed. Vinith’s fingers curled into fists against his knees. Sheeran shifted uncomfortably, his jaw twitching as if resisting the urge to speak.</p>
<p>Doctors in spotless white coats moved in unison. Without hesitation, each raised a syringe filled with a vivid green liquid and drove the needle into the soft spot of a baby’s skull. One by one, the cries halted. The small bodies went limp.</p>
<p>Vinith swallowed hard. Sheeran tried to chuckle under his breath, as if to deflect the pressure forming in his chest—but the sound died halfway. Arin’s gaze didn’t move from the screen, his expression tightening with every silent second.</p>
<p>The scene didn’t pause to let them breathe.</p>
<p>A mechanical screech, like a drill chewing through metal, erupted from somewhere deep in the hall. Each limp infant was fitted with a glowing green chip, embedded into the bone with surgical precision.</p>
<p>The word “Reality” from the start burned in Arin’s mind like a curse. This wasn’t just a story.</p>
<p>From somewhere outside the castle, a roar rose—inhuman, furious—blending with a high-frequency scream that rattled the projection room’s walls. The doctors froze mid-motion. Fear crept into their rigid postures.</p>
<p>A voice echoed from beyond the frame:<br>
“Bíddu, ég mun athuga.” (Wait, I will check.)</p>
<p>Vivan’s eyes sharpened. His lips parted just enough to murmur, almost to himself, “The language of the Gods…”</p>
<p>The tension in the room shifted. Every doctor returned to work, their hands steady but their eyes betraying unease.</p>
<p>A figure appeared.<br>
He walked with straight-backed authority, draped in deep red robes that swallowed his shape. His face was shrouded in shadow, but the weight of his presence pressed against the lungs of everyone watching. He approached the frost-coated window and looked out.</p>
<p>Through the swirling snow, an army advanced—split into six vast divisions, each bearing a different clan’s flag.</p>
<p>The man’s mouth curved into something between a smile and a threat.<br>
“Eins og planað.” (Just as planned.)</p>
<p>The projection snapped into darkness.</p>
<p>A minute stretched unbearably.</p>
<p>“What just happened—” Vivan began, but the words died as the image returned.</p>
<p>The battlefield.<br>
The snow was stained with red. The six armies lay scattered, crushed into the ground, the wind carrying the stench of steel and blood. A text burned across the sky:</p>
<h2>It’s your turn.</h2>
<p>A grinding noise—stone against stone—reverberated through the actual walls of the projection room. Heads whipped toward the far wall, where a colossal map of the world emerged from nothing.</p>
<p>Hearts thundered. The air grew heavy. A white mist began pooling at their feet, creeping upward.</p>
<p>Vinith coughed and tried to wave it away. Wamiqa’s eyes were wide, her hands trembling at her sides. Arin felt his stomach twist into something beyond fear—revulsion, deep and bone-cold. Vivan’s pupils shrank, but his posture didn’t break.</p>
<p>The fog thickened. Vision swam. Limbs weakened. Just before the darkness claimed them completely, a ragged whisper brushed their ears:</p>
<h2>“You are not ready yet.”</h2>
<p>Sheeran’s eyes fluttered open.<br>
The first thing that greeted him was a blur—light seeping through the curtains, shapes bending and wobbling as though his mind was still half-asleep. He blinked several times, trying to clear the fog, until the familiar outlines of his bedroom came into focus.</p>
<p>His head felt heavy, almost as if someone had poured molten lead into it. The dull ache pulsed behind his eyes, each throb making it harder to think. He tried to piece together how he ended up here—what had happened before he fell asleep—but there was nothing. Just an empty stretch of memory.</p>
<p>Dragging himself out of bed, he shuffled to the sink. The splash of cold water hit his face, followed by the sting of minty facewash against his skin. It helped… but only slightly.</p>
<p>When he went downstairs, the first thing he saw was his mother by the door, handbag slung over her shoulder. She was slipping into her shoes, clearly ready to leave for work. Their eyes met for a split second—hers blank, unreadable—before she turned the handle and stepped out without a word.</p>
<p>Sheeran’s jaw tightened. He muttered under his breath, “Damn these adults…” and rolled his eyes toward the wall clock.</p>
<p>The second he saw the time, his stomach dropped.<br>
Late.</p>
<p>In an instant, he was bolting up the stairs, changing clothes, and grabbing his bag. Moments later, he was on his bicycle, feet pounding against the pedals like his life depended on it.</p>
<p>As he sped down the road, the wind rushing past him, his eyes kept flicking to the people on the sidewalks—men in suits, women in formal skirts, all with the same perfectly straight posture and the same fixed, lifeless expression.</p>
<p>Their faces were… empty. Like someone had carved out the part of them that could feel.<br>
Puppets. Every last one of them.</p>
<p>Sheeran’s lips twisted into a smirk of disgust.<br>
“All dressed up, faces frozen… and they call us kids immature.”</p>
<p>He pushed harder on the pedals.</p>
<p>By the time he reached school grounds, his pulse was racing for more reasons than just cycling. He rushed through the corridor—only to spot his homeroom teacher walking toward his classroom.</p>
<p>Instantly, his back straightened. His hurried steps slowed to a calm, composed walk. As they crossed paths, he dipped his head slightly. “Good morning, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed in a knowing way, but her lips curved into a small smile.<br>
“Good morning. And don’t bother hiding it—your face already told me you were late and sprinting.”</p>
<p>Sheeran’s teeth clenched, but a small, awkward smile slipped out anyway. “...Shit, man. I make things obvious,” he muttered to himself as he followed her in.</p>
<p>Inside, he spotted Vinith already seated and slid into the desk beside him. As the teacher arranged her books at the front, Sheeran leaned toward him, voice low and teasing.</p>
<p>“You going through the same thing?”</p>
<p>Vinith didn’t even hesitate—just gave a slow, knowing nod. “Yeah. I remember it was us two… and the three senpai there too.”</p>
<p>Sheeran’s eyes narrowed, his voice dropping even further. “Headache this morning was insane.”</p>
<p>Before Vinith could answer, the teacher’s voice sliced through the air.<br>
“So, let’s start.”</p>
<p>Both boys straightened in their seats, their quiet conversation shelved for now. Whatever had happened… they’d have to piece it together later.</p>
<p><strong>After 6 hours</strong></p>
<p>The last bell rang, sharp and echoing through the corridor. Chairs scraped, bags were slung over shoulders, and students lined up in the aisle like clockwork.</p>
<p>At the front of the room, the teacher stood behind a tall, narrow jar filled with thick red liquid. Its surface caught the light in an oily shimmer, the smell faintly metallic.</p>
<p>One by one, each student stepped forward, bent their head, and received a measured pour onto their scalp. The liquid slid down their hair and temple before soaking into the collar of their shirts.</p>
<p>Sheeran watched his classmates’ faces soften after the pour—eyes calmer, postures looser, almost… empty.</p>
<p>When it was his turn, he clenched his jaw. The red stream hit his head cold, then warm, crawling down his neck. His stomach turned.</p>
<p>He knew what it did. He’d seen it his whole life—the way it smoothed people’s edges, the way it chipped away at whatever made them real. This was the town’s quiet, polite violence.</p>
<p>The teacher gave him the same hollow smile she gave everyone else.</p>
<p>Sheeran stepped away, wiping at his neck with his sleeve as if that could undo anything.</p>
<p>Vinith fell into step beside him, the two drifting out of class without a word. They moved like people weighed down by thoughts too strange to say aloud.</p>
<p>They split at the school gate. Vinith gave a small nod, as if to say we’ll talk later, and headed off. Sheeran mounted his bicycle, adjusting the strap of his bag before pushing off into the road.</p>
<p>The streets felt the same as always—quiet houses, trimmed hedges, neat little storefronts. But he couldn’t stop his eyes from scanning the adults he passed. That dull, lifeless look still clung to their faces, like someone had scraped away the ability to feel.</p>
<p>Halfway down the lane, his gaze snagged on a man standing perfectly still at the corner. The guy was smiling—no, grinning—far too wide. It wasn’t the smile of someone happy to see a kid pass by. It was wrong. Teeth too visible. The muscles in his cheeks stretched too far.</p>
<p>Sheeran’s hands tightened on the handlebars. For a moment, their eyes locked.</p>
<p>He blinked.</p>
<p>The man was gone. In his place, a middle-aged woman strolled by, head down, grocery bag swinging from her hand, her face blank like all the others.</p>
<p>Sheeran swallowed and kicked the pedal harder, glancing back once more before turning toward home.</p>
<p>By the time he reached his street, the whole thing felt like it had slipped into the foggy half-memory that had haunted him since morning. He parked his cycle, jogged up the front steps, and went straight to his room.</p>
<p>That’s when he saw it—a small folded piece of paper, wedged into the frame of his bedroom window from the inside.</p>
<p>His chest tightened.</p>
<p>He picked it up, unfolding it slowly. The page was covered in the same strange jagged text he’d seen on the projector earlier. Only the last line was in English.</p>
<p><em>"You should not have seen it."</em></p>
<p>A shiver worked down his spine. He glanced out the window—</p>
<p>Across the street, an adult was standing perfectly still under the streetlamp, head tilted at an unnatural angle. The light cut across half their face, leaving the other half in complete shadow.</p>
<p>They didn’t move.</p>
<p>Sheeran’s breath caught.</p>
<p>Then the figure slowly raised one hand—not in a wave, but in a stiff, deliberate point—directly at his window.</p>
<p>The paper slipped from his fingers, drifting to the floor.</p>
